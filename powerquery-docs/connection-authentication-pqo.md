# Connections and authentication in Power Query Online

Overview of the feature goes here

## Creating a named connection

The how-to on how to create a connection

## Components of a connection

This is where I go deeper into how each component of the named connection is and why they exist.

1. Data Source kind
2. Data Source path
3. Gateway
4. Credentials
5. Connector specific optional settings
6. Privacy level

## Edit a connection (Data Source Settings)

TBD when we have the "data source settings" feature in PQO so we can edit existing connections.

## More resources
