# Custom Function

What a custom function is. 
Why should I even care about. 
When to use it.

## Create a custom function

Reference the parameter article
Sample with 1 parameter

## Add new parameter to custom function

Sample that works on a single scalar value with just 1 parameter. Then we add a new parameter.

Talk about the link between the function and the query and how it gets updated.

## Invoke Custom Function as a new column

Use the previous custom function to create a new custom column inside a table. 

### Common scenario: Combine files experience

Talk about how this interaction is the core of the Combine files experience and kind of a deep dive into how that one works.
