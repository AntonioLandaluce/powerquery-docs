# Combine Files in Power Query

Applies to: Power Query Desktop, Power Query Online

One powerful capability to import data using Power Query is to combine multiple files from a folder, which have the same schema, into a single logical table. 
To start the process of combining files from the same folder, select one of the folder-based connectors (e.g.: Folder or SharePoint Folder) within Power Query’s Get Data dialog.
