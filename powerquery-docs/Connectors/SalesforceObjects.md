## Connect to Salesforce Objects

To connect to Salesforce Objects data:

1. In the **Get Data** dialog box, enter **Salesforce** in the Search box, select **Salesforce Objects** from the product specific data connector list, and then select **Connect**.

2. In **Salesforce Objects**, choose the **Production** URL if you use the Salesforce production URL (https://www.salesforce.com) to log in.

   You can also select **Custom** and enter a custom URL to log in. This custom URL might be a custom domain you've created within Salesforce, such as https://contoso.salesforce.com. You can also use the custom URL selection if you are using your own CNAME record that redirects to Salesforce.

   In addition, you can select **Include relationship columns**. This selection alters the query by including columns that might have foreign-key relationships to other tables. If this box is unchecked, you wonâ€™t see those columns.

   Once you've selected the URL, select **OK** to continue.

3. Select **Sign in** to sign in to your Salesforce account.

   Once you've successfully signed in, select **Connect**.

4. If this is the first time you've signed in using a specific app, you'll be asked to verify your authenticity by entering a code sent to your email address. You'll then be asked whether you want the app you are using to access the data. For example, you'll be asked if you want to allow Power BI Desktop to access your Salesforce data. Select **Allow**.

5. In the **Navigator** dialog box, select the Salesforce Objects you want to load.

You can then either load or transform the data.

## Known issues and limitations

* There is a limit on the number of fields a query to Salesforce can contain. The limit varies depending on the type of the columns, the number of computed columns, and so on. When you receive an error `Query is either selecting too many fields or the filter conditions are too complicated` it means that your query exceeds the limit. To avoid this, use the **Select Query** advanced option and specify fields that you really need.

* Salesforce session settings can block this integration. Ensure that the setting **Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated** is disabled.

*	Salesforce API access should be enabled. To verify access settings, go to profile settings for the current user and search for "API Enabled" checkbox.

*	Note that Salesforce trial accounts do not have API access.

* Custom fields of type "Picklist (Multi-Select)" are not supported by "Create record" and "Update record" operations.

* Lightning URLs are not supported.
