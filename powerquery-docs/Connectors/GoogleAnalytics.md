Once the connection is established, youâ€™ll see a list of the accounts you have access to. Drill through the account, properties, and views to see a selection of values, categorized in display folders.

You can **Load** the selected table, which brings the entire table into Power BI Desktop, or you can select **Transform Data** to edit the query, which opens Power Query Editor. You can then filter and refine the set of data you want to use, and then load that refined set of data into Power BI Desktop.
