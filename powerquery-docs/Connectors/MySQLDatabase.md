## Prerequisites

By default, Power BI installs an OLE DB driver for MySQL database. However, for optimal performance, we recommend that the customer installs the [SQL Server Native Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/native-client/applications/installing-sql-server-native-client?view=sql-server-ver15) before using the MySQL database connector. SQL Server Native Client 11.0 and SQL Server Native Client 10.0 are both supported in the latest version.

 
## Capabilities Supported
* Import
* Advanced options
    * Command timeout in minutes
    * Native SQL statement
    * Relationship columns
    * Navigate using full hierarchy

The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query Desktop.

| Advanced option	| Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Command timeout in minutes | If your connection lasts longer than 10 minutes (the default timeout), you can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. This option is only available in Power Query Desktop. |
| SQL statement | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). |
| Include relationship columns | If checked, includes columns that might have relationships to other tables. If this box is cleared, you wonâ€™t see those columns. |
| Navigate using full hierarchy | If checked, the navigator displays the complete hierarchy of tables in the database you're connecting to. If cleared, the navigator displays only the tables whose columns and rows contain data. |
| | |

Once you've selected the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop to connect to your MySQL database.
