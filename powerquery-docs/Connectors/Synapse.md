2. To sign in to your Synapse account, select **Sign in**.

3. In the **Sign in with Microsoft** window that appears, provide your credentials to sign in to your Synapse account. Then select **Next**.

4. Once you've successfully signed in, select **Connect**.

Once the connection is established, youâ€™ll see a list of the workspaces you have access to. Drill through the workspaces, databases and tables.

You can **Load** the selected table, which brings the entire table into Power BI Desktop, or you can select **Transform Data** to edit the query, which opens Power Query Editor. You can then filter and refine the set of data you want to use, and then load that refined set of data into Power BI Desktop.


## Troubleshooting

### I do not see my Synapse workspace in the conenctor.

The Synapse Connector is using the [Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to find the Synapse Worspaces you have access to. 

If your access is only defined in the [Synapse RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/synapse-workspace-synapse-rbac), you might not see the workspace.

Make sure your access is defined by Azure RBAC to ensure all Synapse workspaces will show.
