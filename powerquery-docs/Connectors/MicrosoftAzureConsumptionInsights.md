### Transition instructions

Users are instructed to use the certified Microsoft Azure Cost Management connector as a replacement. The table and field names are similar and should offer the same functionality. 

### Timeline

The Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights service will stop working in December 2021. Users should transition off the Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights connector to the Microsoft Azure Cost Management connector by December 2021.
