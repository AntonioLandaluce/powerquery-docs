## Product specific query sharing capabilities

Some Power Query product integrations might offer more ways to share queries such as:
* **In Microsoft Excel** - Creating an Office Data Connection (.odc) to share with other users.

It is recommended that you read the documentation of the product integration that you're interested in to learn more about the query sharing capabilities found within.
