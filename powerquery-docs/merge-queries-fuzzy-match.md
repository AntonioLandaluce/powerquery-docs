# Merge queries: Fuzzy matching

Fuzzy merge is a Smart Data Preparation feature that allows you to apply Fuzzy Matching algorithms when comparing columns and try to find matches across tables being merged. 

Fuzzy matching is only supported on merge operations over text columns. Power Query uses the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to measure the similarity between pairs of instances. 

You can enable Fuzzy matching at the bottom of the **Merge** window by selecting the *Use fuzzy matching to perform the merge* option. Learn more about the *Merge queries* operation and the **Merge** window from the article [Merge queries overview](merge-queries-overview.md).
