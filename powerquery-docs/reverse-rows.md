# Reverse rows

With Power Query, it's possible to reverse the rows of a table with one single click. 

Imagine the table in the following image, with two columns, **ID** and **Country**.

To reverse the rows of this table, go to the **Transform** tab and select the option to reverse rows from the **Table**.
