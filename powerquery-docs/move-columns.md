# Move columns

A common process when preparing data is to move the columns within the dataset. 

To accomplish this, you can either select the **Move** option or *Drag and Drop* the column.


## Move option

To show the different ways of moving columns, we will use the following example.
This example will focus on moving the **Contact Name** column.

Move the column using the **Move** option. This option can be found inside the *Any column* group under the Transform tab. Within the **Move** option, the available choices are.
* Before
* After
* To beginning 
* To end

You can also find this option when you right-click a column.

If you want to move one column to the left then select **Before**.

This is the new location of the column.

If you want to move one column to the right, then select **After**.

If you want to move the column to the most left space of the dataset, then select **To beginning**.

This is the new location of the column.

If you want to move the column to the most right space of the dataset, then select **To end**.

## Drag and drop

Another way to move a column through the dataset is the drag and drop the column.
Move the column to the place that you would like to place it at.

## Go to column feature

If you want to find a specific column, then go to the **View** tab in the ribbon and select **Go to column**.

From there, you will be able to specifically select the column you would like to view. This is especially useful if there are many columns.
