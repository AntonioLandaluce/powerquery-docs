# Query folding basics

Query folding in Power Query is a mechanism where Power Query tries to push as much work as possible to the data source by translating the code generated by Power Query (in the M language) into the native query language of your data source and requesting data from your data source using the translated native query created automatically by the Query folding mechanism. 

Depending on how the query is structured, there could be three (3) possible outcomes for this mechanism:
* **Full translation** - When all of your query transformations get pushed back to the data source and no processing occurs locally by the Power Query engine. Instead you receive your desired output directly from the data source.
* **Partial Translation** - When only a few transformations in your query, and not all, can be pushed back to the data source. This means that a subset of your transformations will be performed at your data source and the rest of your query transformations will occur locally.
* **No Translation** -  When the query contains transformations that can't be translated to the native query langauge of your data source either because the transformations are not supported or the connector doesn't support Query folding. For this case Power Query gets the raw data from your data source and works locally with the Power Query engine to achieve your desired output.

>[!NOTE]
>The Query folding mechanism is primarily available in connectors for structured data sources such as [Microsoft SQL Server](sqlserver.md), but it's also available for other connectors such as the [OData Feed](odatafeed.md). 

## The importance of Query folding

It's important because it makes your queries run faster

### Query with query folding

### Query without query folding

1. SQL Server
2. Excel
3. Merge 
4. Filter 

WHERE

## How to take advantage of Query folding

Follow the best practices
Check the "View native queries"
Run Query diagnostics (and manually interpret the results)
